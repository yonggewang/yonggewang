### Hi there

I like to develop softwares based on my research. The following are some ready to use sources that I have developed. If you are interested in further working on these projects, please feel free to contact me.

- [LIL] (https://github.com/yonggewang/lil) Testing the quality of random generators. 




ðŸ’³ **Donations Are Greatly Appreciated**:

If funds are available, I would like to pay some high quality programmers to work on the blockchain. In particular, I would like to extend the BLDSChain to a hub to connect all Ethereum compatible blochchains (e.g., BSC, etc). 
If you want to support this effort, you can donate funds to the following Ethereum accounts. All your donations will be guaranteed to pay programmers:
