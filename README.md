I like to develop softwares based on my research. The following are some ready to use sources that I have developed. If you are interested in further working on these projects, please feel free to contact me.

- [[lil](url)] (https://github.com/yonggewang/lil) Testing the quality of random generators. This tool can detect weakness in generators that NIST standard tool cannot detect.
- [CoinSwap-Contracts] (https://github.com/coinswapapp) A DeFi swapping platform to reduce front runner chances
- [bdls] (https://github.com/yonggewang/bdls) An efficient BFT protocol BDLS (designed by Yongge Wang) in partial synchronous networks (implemented by others)
- [BDLSChain] (https://github.com/yonggewang/BDLSChain) An prototype blockchain based on BDLS BFT protocol (implemented by others)
- [DAI] (https://github.com/yonggewang/DAI) simplified MakerDAO project smart contracts
- [RLCE] (https://github.com/yonggewang/RLCE) post-quantum secure encryption scheme based on Reed-Solomon codes


ðŸ’³ **Donations For porgrammers are welcome**:

If funds are available, I would like to pay some high quality programmers to work on the blockchain. In particular, I would like to extend the BLDSChain to a hub to connect all Ethereum compatible blochchains (e.g., BSC, etc). 
If you want to support this effort, you can donate funds to the following Ethereum accounts. All your donations will be guaranteed to pay programmers:
